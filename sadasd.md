Introduction
Video gaming has come a long way since the early days of Pong and Pac-man. We can now play affordable games of high caliber with 3D graphics and awesome interactivity in the comfort of our home, taking for granted the little and subtle improvements made to each and every console before becoming what they are today. In a way, the aggressive competition between companies of video game consoles had churned out the superior features of video gaming to bring to us the excellent quality we see today.
There were more than 70 different consoles to date and now we are in the peak era of gaming console and video games. Now there are PS4, Xbox One X and Nintendo switch which are the latest consoles. There are still upcoming consoles which is the PS5 but besides gaming consoles a new era of gaming is starting to begin where there is no need of a console. You can play the same games in your mobile, TV, Computers and the best part is you can play it in a web browser you just need an internet access. With just a good internet access you can play the best upcoming, ongoing, past every game as you wish. So, what is this new era of gaming which will change the gaming world and will become the start of a new technological gaming era and maybe a light to the future of mankind’s technologies.


This new technology is called cloud gaming also known as game streaming. Cloud gaming refers to using cloud servers rather than the local devices to run games Essentially the goal is to make high end gaming experiences simpler and cheaper to access. The major and the best advantages of the cloud gaming are: The first is that users don’t have to buy new hardware every few years in order to run the latest and greatest games. The other is that theoretically allows users to play any game on any devices with a screen and an internet connection. There are many types of different cloud gaming which will be addressed below.

Literature Review
Cloud Gaming
Cloud gaming is a method of playing video games that is done using remote hardware typically taking the form of servers owned by separate company. Instead of downloading a game onto your system or installing it by physical media and playing it locally, cloud gaming relies on internet streaming to deliver games on your device of choice. This means that your console, television mobile phone or computer is not relying on its own internal hardware to power the games as a result games incapable of running locally on a system can easily run by using cloud gaming. Cloud gaming requires a persistent internet connection in order to operate as none of the information including save data is stored on the system your using but is stored remotely. There are three types of cloud gaming. Game streaming, peer to peer gaming and progressive downloading.
Types of Cloud Gaming
Game Streaming
Game streaming is a type of online gaming that allows direct and on demand video streaming of games onto computer consoles and mobile devices similar to video on demand through the use of a thin client. The actual game is stored executed and rendered on the remote operators or game companies’ server and the video results are streamed directly to a consumer’s computers over the internet. This allows access to games without the need of a console or high-end gaming computers and largely makes the capability of the user’s computer unimportant as the server is the system that is running the processing needs. The controls and button press from the user are transmitted directly to the server where they are recorded and the serer the sends back the games response to the input controls.
Peer to Peer Gaming
P2P gaming is type of a cloud gaming where client devices communicate directly back and forth without fist reaching an intermediary server. The critical difference from cloud gaming is that game is executed on an actual PC and it is streamed on one to one basis. The actual game is stored, executed, and rendered on the remote computer station and the video results are streamed directly to a consumer's computer over the internet. P2P cloudless gaming allows closing latency gap: the remote computer could be located within one internet provider. The network protocol in P2P cloud gaming smartly chooses the best fit between the remote computer and the consumer's device. 
Progressive Downloading
Cloud gaming based on file streaming, also known as "progressive downloading", deploys a thin client in which the actual game is run on the user's gaming device, such as a mobile device, a PC, or a console. A small part of a game, usually less than 5% of the total game size, is downloaded initially so that the gamer can start playing quickly. he remaining game content is downloaded to the end user's device while playing. This allows instant access to games with low bandwidth Internet connections without lag. The cloud is used for providing a scalable way of streaming the game content and big data analysis. Cloud gaming based on file streaming requires a device that has the hardware capabilities to operate the game. Often, downloaded game content is stored on the end user's device where it is downloaded.

What is the difference in cloud gaming and console gaming?
	Console	Cloud service
Popular available services	Nintendo,,PlayStation,,Xbox	Apple Arcade, Project Google Stadia, Project xCloud
Price type	Upfront	Monthly subscription
Free trial available	NO	YES
Storage	On hardware	Unlimited
Offline play	Yes 	On Apple Arcade
Resolution	1080p	4K
Key features	Downloadable content, game, play offline	No hardware, multi-device and traditional controller combability

The main difference between them is console gaming consists mainly like buying a soft copy or a hard copy of the game and installing it which consumes massive amount of storage whereas in cloud gaming the user only needs to be subscribed to the cloud server and play as they wish in their devices. They don’t need to install anything about the game. In cloud game internet connection is the vital thing so the user must have good internet foundation so that he or she don’t get any frame drops, quality drops or ping(ms) while they are playing but in console gaming the user can also play offline because the game is already inside their hardware device.
Why is cloud gaming essential in gaming industry?
The gaming industry is exploding numerous services and facilities offered by different technological platforms. In recent years, game streaming services have become extremely popular by attracting billions of gamers around the world. Gaming as a service the cloud-based gaming allows players to the participate and play together in the common online game from different remote locations with the common online game from different remote locations with the robust communication facilities. Currently tech companies are contributing initiate solution to transform the wat video games are played distributed and sold in the global market.
Taking over the traditional gaming ways such as sliding the disc into the game console or downloading files onto a drive the cloud game streaming services do not require a box or hardware to run. The cloud game provides manage the game console in the cloud with advanced capabilities to handle multi players and can be accessible on phones and laptops or Pcs with a regular browser. Like the online video streaming platform, the cloud-based game streaming portals offers various features and options with subscription variations.
A gamer can dedicate gaming without building, buying or carrying specific game sets or tools which also eliminates the need for downloads or updates regularly.
The growth of cloud computing and rise in its adoption level by different service providers boost the scale of its gaming business in the global market. The giant game providers collaborate with various platform to build a complete future game service with unique features and broad accessibility. The cloud streaming can potentially reduce distribution costs and increase margins in exchange for higher spending on content, marketing and gaming support. The cloud portal provides developers with a secure channel to inject fresh supply of games without customizing the game for platform combability.
The cloud game streaming service opens new opportunities for gamers to gain recognition in the industry. The rise of gamers as a service-based model gives way to further monetization of the developers work without raising the price base. The innovative service can completely change the history of gaming allowing rapid entry to PC-level gamers and audiences. The gaming market is yet to explore big hits in the sales and business growth encouraging the market professionals of the industry to explore and adopt new technologies.
How will cloud gaming affect the gaming industry?
To properly estimate what kind of effect cloud computing will have on the video game industry, we must first look at how video games are currently using the cloud. Perhaps the most common use of cloud computing at the moment is cloud storage. Gamers have the opportunity to save games onto cloud servers provided by gaming bigwigs like Microsoft and Sony. Some developers and publishers provide saved game storage space as well. The arrival of the current generation consoles (Xbox One, PlayStation 4, WiiU) has also ushered in a wealth of new capabilities with the cloud. When the Xbox One was first announced in the spring of 2013, Microsoft touted that the company would have 300000 dedicated cloud servers for the purpose of adding extra processing power to Xbox games. It is this capability that, while used to an extent today, could be even farther reaching in the future.
When it comes to predicting what the future holds for cloud computing and video games, we must first stop looking at PCs and consoles as isolated machines. For years they operated as such, much like a self-contained unit for the sole purpose of running purchased games. The cloud is changing that conventional image. With the benefit of cloud computing's added processing power, some of the tasks normally associated with consoles and PCs can be offloaded to the cloud. This can easily lead to an overall improved gaming experience. For example, under the old model, all rendering and AI would have to be computed by the local machine. 
Those processes, including physics modeling and even cloth motion, can now be taken to the cloud and its added computing power. In other words, consoles and PCs don't have to handle the calculations on its own, which can bring crisper textures, smoother gameplay, and improved graphics to your living room.
The idea of even purchasing a physical copy of a game may become a thing of the past thanks to the cloud. While many gamers currently download their games from company servers, the cloud may render that obsolete as well. Games in the future may instead be directly streamed to the gamer's local machine or television.
The cloud may also prove revolutionary to developers. Instead of spending large amounts of resources on infrastructure, developers may instead have access to cloud computing technology, giving them an added boost in creating their games.
All of these capabilities and theoretical uses are merely scratching the surface of the cloud's potential. By taking hold of the advantages of cloud computing video game developers have the opportunity to propel the industry into a new age. The full realization of cloud computing's benefits may still be a number of years off, but there's no denying that the future may look radically different compared to the current state of gaming.
 

When is cloud gaming going to overtake traditional gaming?
There is no any time when cloud gaming will overtake traditional gaming system but as there is a pandemic in the world and the world economy is becoming worse day by day and this only means that the price of consoles and pc are getting higher so, maybe in this period of time cloud gaming can shine a little but there is not many system as there is Google Stadia project which hasn’t still fully released, PS4 now is available but only to limited countries, Xbox Now is the only one which is fully out but still not that much popular in the gaming community.
As for future years cloud gaming can become the best choice to play games in countries which have really good internet foundations but in countries which doesn’t have good internet foundation can still use traditional gaming system but as years pass most of the countries have good internet therefore there is a good future for cloud gaming but there is no any certain time for cloud gaming to become number 1 in gaming industry.
